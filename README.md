# Fashion MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for training a neural network model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of 10 different types of clothing items, and the goal is to predict the correct label for each image.

## Overview

The code demonstrates how to:
- Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Build a simple neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Train the model on the training data
- Evaluate the model on the test data
- Visualize an example image from the training set

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
